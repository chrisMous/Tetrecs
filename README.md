Puzzle Block Game with Single Player and Multiplayer modes

The Goal of the game is to clear rows and columns by placing blocks on a grid and avoid running out of time and lives.

The Single Player portion of the game compares the player's score with scores collected by the server that the game is run on, whilst the objective of the Multiplayer game
is to beat the score of other players that join your session. Moreover, the Multiplayer lobby has a working chat that updates in real-time just like the scores of the game.

The game includes customizable backgrounds and music and soundFX volume sliders that allow you to customize your gaming experience. 

The various values that are displayed in the game are updated via the use of Listeners with the use of message parsing from the communicator that acts as the link from 
the web server the game is run on to the actual game.

The game was developed and managed with the use of Maven.
